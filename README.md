#Dragonfly Macros
A set of macros to assist coding by voice.
The macros work with the [dragonfly library](
  http://dragonfly.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

###Installation
Assuming you hiked the mountain of pain that is [setting up the dragonfly library](https://github.com/simianhacker/code-by-voice#getting-started),
simply place all the python files in the MacroSystem directory
(which is presumably located at C:\\Natlink\Natlink\Macrosystem).
